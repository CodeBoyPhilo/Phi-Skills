# Phi's Skills

This repo contains my customised "skills" for coding/research agent.

## Installation

While you can always manually download it and place it into the right location, I recommend automatic installation with:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/CodeBoyPhilo/Phi-Skills.git
```

## Included skills

- `summarise-paper`
  - summarise an academic PDF into a standalone LaTeX note
  - built on top of OpenAI's [pdf](https://github.com/openai/skills/blob/main/skills/.curated/pdf/SKILL.md) skill, used AI (GPT 5.2) to polish
  - I use it with `GPT-5.2 high`
